# SourdoughApp
A web API and app to make sourdough bread.

<< UNDERWAY >>
After years of collecting bread recipes, I've always wanted to write my own hydration calculator. I have something that I can use in a console application, but it isn't very accessible or functional. This is my personal attempt to create a web application that takes into account the experience for the user baking bread. 

<< FUTURE BUILD >>
In addition to calculations that assist with interpreting the hydration and composition of bread recipes, I hope that this app could generate a boilerplate bread recipe of high enough quality to share on social media or print out and put in a recipe book someday.
