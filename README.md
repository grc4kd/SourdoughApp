# SourdoughApp
A web API and app to make sourdough bread.

<< UNDERWAY >>
After years of collecting bread recipes, I've always wanted to write my own hydration calculator. I have something that I can use in a console application, but it isn't very accessible or functional. This is my personal attempt to create a web application that takes 
into account the experience for the user baking bread. 

<< FUTURE BUILD >>
In addition to calculations that assist with interpreting the hydration and composition of bread recipes, I hope that this app could generate a "boilerplate" 
bread recipe of high enough quality to share on social media or print out and frame on the fridge with a magnet. * We should have fridge magnets! *

  + TODO: added branch tdd
    - to redevelop this application using TDD there are tests, but I didn't write them first breadmaking might be trivial, but this example is contrived
